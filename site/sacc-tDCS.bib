abstract = {We review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that carry out different attentional functions. One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.},

abstract = {There are several eye fields in the primate frontal cortex. The number and location of these oculomotor control zones remain controversial, especially in the human brain. In the monkey, the frontal eye field (FEF) is located in the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus at approximately the level of the posterior end of the sulcus principalis, the supplementary eye field (SEF) is located on the dorsomedial frontal cortex, and the cingulate eye field (CEF) in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus. In the human frontal cortex, the location of the FEF varies depending on the method used, electrical stimulation or functional neuroimaging, to establish it. Some investigators have argued that the SEF is located on the medial wall of the frontal lobe but its presumed location remains controversial. The location of the CEF in the human brain is not known. The present article reviews electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging evidence regarding the location of these frontal oculomotor areas in the macaque monkey and human brains and, in light of new findings in the human brain, attempts to reconcile the differences observed in the location of these eye fields using the different techniques. Together, these data suggest the existence of at least four eye fields in the frontal cortex, i.e. the FEF, the SEF, the CEF, and a premotor eye field, and suggest that their anatomical relationships are preserved from monkey to human brain.},

With TMS delivered in the reaction time foreperiod of auditory-triggered saccades, saccade onset could be delayed by up to 60 ms. The area of cortex over which TMS could delay saccade onset was located near the inter-aural line, approximately 6 cm lateral to the vertex, and was situated between areas over which TMS could generate motor evoked potentials in muscles of the hand and face. It is concluded that this area corresponds to the human frontal eye field and is closely associated with the motor strip, at a level between the representations of the hand and the face, and that stimulation of this region can interfere with the programming and execution of externally triggered saccades},

Within this network, the Eye Fields have been described in animals as cortical regions in which electrical stimulation is able to trigger eye movements and influence their latency or accuracy. This review focuses on the Frontal Eye Field (FEF) a "hub" region located in Humans in the vicinity of the pre-central sulcus and the dorsal-most portion of the superior frontal sulcus. The straightforward localization of the FEF through electrical stimulation in animals is difficult to translate to the healthy human brain, particularly with non-invasive neuroimaging techniques. Hence, in the first part of this review, we describe attempts made to characterize the anatomical localization of this area in the human brain. The outcome of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magneto-encephalography (MEG) and particularly, non-invasive mapping methods such a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) are described and the variability of FEF localization across individuals and mapping techniques are discussed. In the second part of this review, we will address the role of the FEF. We explore its involvement both in the physiology of fixation, saccade, pursuit, and vergence movements and in associated cognitive processes such as attentional orienting, visual awareness and perceptual modulation. Finally in the third part, we review recent evidence suggesting the high level of malleability and plasticity of these regions and associated networks to non-invasive stimulation. The exploratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic interest of such interventions for the modulation and improvement of perception in 3D space are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Over the last 15-years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a relatively novel form of neuromodulation, has seen a surge of popularity in both clinical and academic settings. Despite numerous claims suggesting that a single session of tDCS can modulate cognition in healthy adult populations (especially working memory and language production), the paradigms utilized and results reported in the literature are extremely variable. To address this, we conduct the largest quantitative review of the cognitive data to date. METHODS Single-session tDCS data in healthy adults (18–50) from every cognitive outcome measure reported by at least two different research groups in the literature was collected. Outcome measures were divided into 4 broad categories: executive function, language, memory, and miscellaneous. To account for the paradigmatic variability in the literature, we undertook a three-tier analysis system; each with less-stringent inclusion criteria than the prior. Standard mean difference values with 95{\%} CIs were generated for included studies and pooled for each analysis. RESULTS Of the 59 analyses conducted, tDCS was found to not have a significant effect on any – regardless of inclusion laxity. This includes no effect on any working memory outcome or language production task. CONCLUSION Our quantitative review does not support the idea that tDCS generates a reliable effect on cognition in healthy adults. Reasons for and limitations of this finding are discussed. This work raises important questions regarding the efficacy of tDCS, state-dependency effects, and future directions for this tool in cognitive research.},

abstract = {A current issue in the research of augmentation of brain functions using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is the diversity and inconsistency in outcome results. Similar studies often report different results, depending on the parameters and tasks used. Such inconsistencies have led to significant doubts about the efficacy of the method in the broader scientific community, despite its promising potential for patient recovery and treatment. Evidence on the large variability in individual cortical excitability and response to tES suggests that stimulation may affect individuals differently, depending on the subject's age, gender, brain state, hormonal levels, and pre-existing regional excitability. Certain factors might even lead to the reversal of polarity-dependent effects, and therefore have crucial implications for neurorehabilitation and cognitive enhancement. Research paradigms may have to be refined in the future to avoid the confounding effects of such factors.},

Relevance of individual differences in responsiveness to tES.















Subject






















Key findings






















Outstanding questions






















Significance






















Sources of individual variability:






















Neurotransmitter balances. Individual brains differ in local concentrations of GABA, glutamate, and neuromodulators, all of which are known to interact with tDCS. In particular, the balance between excitation and inhibition (Krause et al., 2013) seems crucial for the dose-response relationship of tDCS. This can be assessed in humans through MRS measures of glutamate (excitation) and GABA (inhibition).















Current application. There are many different (combinations of) stimulation parameters and montages available. One idea is that interhemispheric inhibition is a main determinant of tDCS efficacy, which might vary across different subjects.















Research design, Individuals more sensitive to tDCS might show greater cumulative effects in repeated session designs.















The intitial brain state. Subject factors and their corresponding brain states may heavily influence or even completely flip (polarity-opposing) tDCS effects. For example, fatigue/attention{\~{}}ongoing alpa activity, habituation{\~{}}neural adaptation, task processing vs. resting state, etc.















The individual brain. Participants may use different strategies that recruit different brain areas, so you might be stimulation an area not actively-involved in the task. 
Head anatomy related factors such as skull thickness and subcutaneous fat density can impact current density.
Differences in sulcal/gyral morphology can lead to different cellular effects of tDCS across participants, as these depend on the neuronal orientation along the electric field. In addition to local brain anatomy, variation in the strength of connections between brain areas could also produce different tDCS effects, as its actions are not merely local.















The developing and again brain. Brain structure, baseline cortical excitability, and neurotransmitter levels change with age, and thus so will the associated tDCS effects.















Circadian rhythm. Sleep and time of day may affect cortical excitability and thereby dimish/facilitate tDCS effects.















Hormonal levels. Hormone levels affect cortical inhibition/excitation, most notably in different phases of the menstrual cycle (Figure 1).},

abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been successfully applied to cortical areas such as the motor cortex and visual cortex. In the present study, we examined whether tDCS can reach and selectively modulate the excitability of the frontal eye field (FEF). In order to assess potential effects of tDCS, we measured saccade latency, landing point, and its variability in a simple prosaccade task and in an antisaccade task. In the prosaccade task, we found that anodal tDCS shortened the latency of saccades to a contralateral visual cue. However, cathodal tDCS did not show a significant modulation of saccade latency. In the antisaccade task, on the other hand, we found that the latency for ipisilateral antisaccades was prolonged during the stimulation, whereas anodal stimulation did not modulate the latency of antisaccades. In addition, anodal tDCS reduced the erroneous saccades toward the contralateral visual cue. These results in the antisaccade task suggest that tDCS modulates the function of FEF to suppress reflexive saccades to the contralateral visual cue. Both in the prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, we did not find any effect of tDCS on saccade landing point or its variability. Our present study is the first to show effects of tDCS over FEF and opens the possibility of applying tDCS for studying the functions of FEF in oculomotor and attentional performance.},

abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate in the intact human the possibility of a non-invasive modulation of motor cortex excitability by the application of weak direct current through the scalp. Excitability changes of up to 40 {\%}, revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation, were accomplished and lasted for several minutes after the end of current stimulation. Excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. By varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after-effects could be controlled. The effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. Functional alterations related to post-tetanic potentiation, short-term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation. Transcranial electrical stimulation using weak current may thus be a promising tool to modulate cerebral excitability in a non-invasive, painless, reversible, selective and focal way.},

[title]

Hypothesis 
Replicate in humans that anodal/cathodal stimulation increases/decreases neural excitability, indexed by MEP size.

Methods 
35 square cm saline-soaked sponges at motor cortex and contralateral forehead.
4s and 1-5 min current flow, 0.2-1 mA.

Key findings 
Exp1: Only the motor cortex - contralateral forehead montage produced the hypothesized modulation, all others (anterior, posterior, contralateral to motor cortex, and occipital) were ineffective (Fig. 1).

Exp2: 5min of 1mA stimulation produced hypothesized MEP changes outlasting stimulation, initially 30-40{\%} but diminishing steadily and dissapearing after 4 minutes (Fig. 2).

Exp3: At least 3 min of 1 mA stimulation was required to induce after effects. Higher current strength and/or duration increased MEP size (Fig. 3)

Context 
Landmark study that rekindled the modern interest in tDCS. After Priori (1998) but much more systematic and succesful. tDCS parameters as pioneered here (montage, 1 mA current) is still used to this day.

Significance 
Major, still useful today, although primarily historically.

abstract = {A dorsal frontoparietal network, including regions in intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal eye field (FEF), has been hypothesized to control the allocation of spatial attention to environmental stimuli. One putative mechanism of control is the desynchronization of electroencephalography (EEG) alpha rhythms (approximately 8-12 Hz) in visual cortex in anticipation of a visual target. We show that brief interference by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with preparatory activity in right IPS or right FEF while subjects attend to a spatial location impairs identification of target visual stimuli approximately 2 s later. This behavioral effect is associated with the disruption of anticipatory (prestimulus) alpha desynchronization and its spatially selective topography in parieto-occipital cortex. Finally, the disruption of anticipatory alpha rhythms in occipital cortex after right IPS- or right FEF-rTMS correlates with deficits of visual identification. These results support the causal role of the dorsal frontoparietal network in the control of visuospatial attention, and suggest that this is partly exerted through the synchronization of occipital visual neurons.},

abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) causes a complex spatial distribution of the electric current flow in the head which hampers the accurate localization of the stimulated brain areas. In this study we show how various anatomical features systematically shape the electric field distribution in the brain during tDCS. We constructed anatomically realistic finite element (FEM) models of two individual heads including conductivity anisotropy and different skull layers. We simulated a widely employed electrode montage to induce motor cortex plasticity and moved the stimulating electrode over the motor cortex in small steps to examine the resulting changes of the electric field distribution in the underlying cortex. We examined the effect of skull thickness and composition on the passing currents showing that thinner skull regions lead to higher electric field strengths. This effect is counteracted by a larger proportion of higher conducting spongy bone in thicker regions leading to a more homogenous current over the skull. Using a multiple regression model we could identify key factors that determine the field distribution to a significant extent, namely the thicknesses of the cerebrospinal fluid and the skull, the gyral depth and the distance to the anode and cathode. These factors account for up to 50{\%} of the spatial variation of the electric field strength. Further, we demonstrate that individual anatomical factors can lead to stimulation "hotspots" which are partly resistant to electrode positioning. Our results give valuable novel insights in the biophysical foundation of tDCS and highlight the importance to account for individual anatomical factors when choosing an electrode montage},

Methods: Twelve healthy subjects participated in four different experimental conditions. The stimulation electrode was always placed over the primary motor cortex; the reference electrode was placed at the contralateral orbit or at the ipsilateral/contralateral arm. MEPs were recorded in order to measure changes in cortical excitability over time. Results: The distance between the two electrodes correlates negatively with the duration and magnitude of induced after-effects. Conclusions: In particular when using extracephalic reference electrodes with transcranial electric stimulation techniques, the stimulation intensity has to be adapted to account for interelectrode distance. Significance: Electrode distance plays a critical role in the induction for stimulation after-effects in tDCS and tRNS studies, and must be taken into account in future studies and also when making comparisons with the published literature. ?? 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare the effect duration of two different protocols of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on saccade triggering. In four experiments, two regions (right frontal eye field (FEF) and vertex) were stimulated using a 1-Hz and a theta burst protocol (three 30 Hz pulses repeated at intervals of 100 ms). The same number of TMS pulses (600 pulses) was applied with stimulation strength of 80{\%} of the resting motor threshold for hand muscles. Following stimulation the subjects repeatedly performed an oculomotor task using a modified overlap paradigm, and saccade latencies were measured over a period of 60 min. The results show that both 1-Hz and theta burst stimulation had inhibitory effects on saccade triggering when applied over the FEF, but not over the vertex. One-hertz rTMS significantly increased saccade latencies over a period of about 8 min. After theta burst rTMS, this effect lasted up to 30 min. Furthermore, the decay of rTMS effects was protocol-specific: After 1-Hz stimulation, saccade latencies returned to a baseline level much faster than after theta burst stimulation. We speculate that these time course differences represent distinct physiological mechanisms of how TMS interacts with brain function. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Bayesian hypothesis testing presents an attractive alternative to p value hypothesis testing. Part I of this series outlined several advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing, including the ability to quantify evidence and the ability to monitor and update this evidence as data come in, without the need to know the intention with which the data were collected. Despite these and other practical advantages, Bayesian hypothesis tests are still reported relatively rarely. An important impediment to the widespread adoption of Bayesian tests is arguably the lack of user-friendly software for the run-of-the-mill statistical problems that confront psychologists for the analysis of almost every experiment: the t-test, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and contingency tables. In Part II of this series we introduce JASP (http://www.jasp-stats.org), an open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly graphical software package that allows users to carry out Bayesian hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems. JASP is based in part on the Bayesian analyses implemented in Morey and Rouder's BayesFactor package for R. Armed with JASP, the practical advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing are only a mouse click away.},

[title]

Hypothesis 
Applying tDCS for minutes instead of seconds would elicit prolonged changes in MEP amplitudes.

Methods 
1 mA DC for 5-13 minutes in 2-minute steps. 
35 square cm sponge electrodes. Anode over motor cortex (ADM representation), cathode over contralateral orbit.

Key findings 
13 minutes of tDCS produced elevated MEP amplitudes (150{\%}) for up to 90 minutes after stimulation.
9-min tDCS: 30 min after effect.
5 {\&} 7-min tDCS: 5 min after effect. (Fig. 1)

Context 
Follow-up to Nitsche {\&} Paulus (2000), their first tDCS paper in which they stimulated for only seconds. This is their most highly cited paper, showing that prolonged changes after stimulation can be achieved by increasing stimulation duration, opening up the potential for all sorts of (clinical) applications.

Significance 
Huge, as the first multi-minute tDCS study and a proof of principle.

abstract = {Eye movements were recorded electro-oculographically in three patients with a small ischemic lesion affecting the left frontal eye field (FEF) and in 12 control subjects. Reflexive visually guided saccades (gap and overlap tasks), antisaccades, predictive saccades, memory-guided saccades, smooth pursuit and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) were studied in the three patients. Staircase saccades and double step saccades were also studied in one of the three patients. For both leftward and rightward saccades, latency in the overlap task (but not in the gap task) and that of correct antisaccades and of memory-guided saccades was significantly increased, compared with the results of controls. There was a significant decrease in the amplitude gain of all rightward saccades programmed using retinotopic coordinates (gap and overlap tasks, predictive and memory-guided saccades), whereas the amplitude gain of corresponding leftward saccades was preserved. Such an asymmetry between leftward and rightward saccades was significant. In the staircase paradigm as well as for the first saccade in the double step paradigm (with the use of retinotopic coordinates in both cases), the amplitude gain of rightward saccades was also significantly lower than that of leftward saccades. Moreover, in the double step paradigm, the amplitude gain of the first rightward saccade was significantly lower than that of the second rightward saccade (programmed using extraretinal signals), which was preserved. The percentage of errors in the antisaccade task did not differ significantly from that of normal subjects. In the predictive saccade paradigm, the percentage of predictive rightward saccades was significantly decreased. The left smooth pursuit gain for all tested velocities, the right smooth pursuit gain for higher velocities, and the left OKN gain were significantly decreased. The results show, for the first time in humans, that the FEF plays an important role in (1) the disengagement from central fixation, (2) the control of contralateral saccades programmed using retinotopic coordinates, (3) saccade prediction and (4) the control of smooth pursuit and OKN, mainly ipsilaterally. In contrast, the left FEF did not appear to be crucial for the control of the only type of saccades programmed using extraretinal signals studied here.},

For quantification of current-induced excitability changes, we measured phosphene threshold (PT) using short trains of 5-Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses in nine healthy subjects before, immediately after, 10 min, and 20 min after the end of tDCS. PTs are suggested as representative values of visual cortex excitability changes.

abstract = {Extracellular recordings were made simultaneously in the frontal eye field and superior colliculus in awake, behaving rhesus monkeys. Frontal eye field microstimulation was used to orthodromically activate the superior colliculus both to locate the depth of the strongest frontal eye field input to the superior colliculus and to identify superior colliculus neurons receiving direct frontal eye field input. The activity of orthodromically driven colliculus neurons was characterized during visuomotor tasks. The purpose of this study was to identify the types of superior colliculus neurons that receive excitatory frontal eye field input. We found that microstimulation of the frontal eye field did not activate the superficial layers of the superior colliculus but did activate the deeper layers. This pattern of activation coincided with the prevalence of visual versus saccade-related activity in the superficial and deep layers. A total of 83 orthodromically driven superior colliculus neurons were identified. Of these neurons, 93{\%} (n = 77) exhibited a burst of activity associated with the onset of the saccade, and 25{\%} (n = 21) exhibited prelude/build-up activity prior to the onset of a saccade. In addition, it was common to see some activity synchronized with the onset of a visual target (30{\%}, n = 25). In single neurons, these activity profiles could be observed alone or in combination. Superior colliculus neurons that were exclusively visual, however, were not excited by frontal eye field stimulation. We compared the activity of superior colliculus neurons that received frontal eye field input to descriptions of saccade-related neurons made in earlier reports and found that the distribution of neuron types in the orthodromically driven population was similar to the distribution within the overall population. This suggests that the frontal eye field does not selectively influence a specific class of collicular neurons, but, instead has a direct influence on all preparatory, and saccade-related activity within the deep layers of the superior colliculus.},

abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly used in research and clinical settings, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is often chosen as a target for stimulation. While numerous studies report modulation of cognitive abilities following DLPFC stimulation, the wide array of cognitive functions that can be modulated makes it difficult to predict its precise outcome. 

OBJECTIVE
The present review aims at identifying and characterizing the various cognitive domains affected by tDCS over DLPFC. 

METHODS
Articles using tDCS over DLPFC indexed in PubMed and published between January 2000 and January 2014 were included in the present review. 

RESULTS
tDCS over DLPFC affects a wide array of cognitive functions, with sometimes apparent conflicting results. 

CONCLUSION
Prefrontal tDCS has the potential to modulate numerous cognitive functions simultaneously, but to properly interpret the results, a clear a priori hypothesis is necessary, careful technical consideration are mandatory, further insights into the neurobiological impact of tDCS are needed, and consideration should be given to the possibility that some behavioral effects may be partly explained by parallel modulation of related functions.},

abstract = {The location and possible function of the human frontal eye-field (FEF) were evaluated by reviewing results of cerebral blood-flow (CBF) and lesion studies. A remarkable consistency was found regarding the rostro-caudal (Y: from -6 to 1 mm) and dorso-ventral (Z: from 44 to 51 mm) location of the FEF, as defined by the CBF method within a standardized stereotaxic system (the zero point for all X, Y and Z coordinates coinciding with the anterior commissure, Talairach and Tournoux [Co-planar Stereotactic Atlas of the Human Brain, Georg Thieme, Stuttgart, 1988]. In contrast, there was a marked variability along the mediolateral axis (X: from -24 to -40 mm for the left hemisphere and from 21 to 40 mm for the right hemisphere). The human FEF is thus located either in the vicinity of the precentral sulcus and/or in the depth of the caudalmost part of the superior frontal sulcus. In either case, this location challenges the commonly held view of the FEF being located in Broadmann's area 8. With regard to FEF function, the results of CBF studies failed to support a role for the FEF in the cognitive aspects of oculomotor control, such as the execution of anti-saccades. Blood-flow activation data are consistent in this respect with the results of lesion studies. It is proposed that future research on FEF function in human subjects may benefit from focusing on the visuomotor rather than the cognitive aspects of oculomotor control.},

abstract = {Neuroplastic changes are defined as enduring changes in the organization of the central nervous system, such as the strength of connections, representational patterns, or neuronal properties, either morphological or functional. In recent years, new tools have emerged to induce and manipulate ongoing neuroplastic changes by external stimulation, either by modification of synchronized neuronal activity or modulation of the spontaneous firing rate. The first is performed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the latter by direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS as a tool aims to induce prolonged neuronal excitability and activity alterations in the human brain via alterations of the neuronal membrane potential and results in prolonged synaptic efficacy changes. Apart from its impressive persistent excitability effects, it is a non-invasive method and can be applied painlessly. Most likely that up- or downregulation of different cortical areas by tDCS will open a new branch in the area of visual psychophysics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The current research set out to determine whether similar results can be produced using a clinically practical protocol, whether tDCS applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) might also afford benefits, and whether benefits extend to older adults. Twenty young and 10 older adults completed two active (FEF and DLPFC) and one sham stimulation session. To aid clinical translation, the method of positioning the electrodes entailed simple measurements only. Saccadic performance following anodal tDCS applied over the FEF or DLPFC did not differ from the sham condition in either age group. Additionally, saccadic performance contralateral to the active electrodes showed no evidence of benefits over ipsilateral performance. These results call into question whether the protocol utilized can be applied effectively using only simple measurements to localize the relevant frontal subregion. Future efforts to develop a clinically practical tDCS proto- col to improve saccadic eye movement control should include a sham control condition and consider adjusting the tDCS electrode montage and current strength to optimize the chances of conferring benefits in the population under study},

Two primary nodes on this network are right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) and right frontal eye fields. Both have been shown to be involved in the orientation of attention, but the contingency that the activity of one of these areas has on the other is less clear. We sought to investigate this question by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to selectively decrease activity in rPPC and then asking participants to perform a visual search task whilst undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Comparison with a condition in which sham tDCS was applied revealed that cathodal tDCS over rPPC causes a selective bilateral decrease in frontal activity when performing a visual search task. This result demonstrates for the first time that premotor regions within the frontal lobe and rPPC are not only necessary to carry out a visual search task, but that they work together to bring about normal function.},

Given that these are fundamental cognitive functions, they may also mediate stimulation effects on other higher-order processes such as decision-making and problem solving. Although tDCS research is still young, there have been a variety of methods used and cognitive processes tested. While these different methods have resulted in seemingly contradictory results among studies, many consistent and noteworthy effects of tDCS on attention, learning, and memory have been reported. The literature suggests that although tDCS as typically applied may not be as useful for localization of function in the brain as some other methods of brain stimulation, tDCS may be particularly well-suited for practical applications involving the enhancement of attention, learning, and memory, in both healthy subjects and in clinical populations.},

However, the current fervour for tES contrasts with the paucity of mechanistically detailed models of how stimulation causes behavioural change. Here we challenge the plausibility of several common assumptions and interpretations of tES and discuss how to bridge the ravines separating our understanding of the behavioural and neural consequences of tES. We argue that rational application of tES should occur in tandem with computational neurostimulation and appropriate physiological and behavioural assays. This will aid appreciation of the limitations of tES and generate testable predictions of how tES expresses its effects on behaviour.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modify the perception threshold of phosphenes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The current study was undertaken to examine whether tDCS, when applied over the occipital cortex, is also able to affect visual-evoked potentials (VEPs), which characterize occipital activation in response to visual stimulation, in a polarity-specific way. METHOD. For this purpose, VEPs evoked by sinusoidal luminance grating in an on/off mode were recorded before, immediately after, and 10, 20, and 30 minutes after the end of 5, 10, or 15 minutes of anodal or cathodal tDCS of the primary visual cortex. RESULTS. Significant effects were observed only when low-contrast visual stimuli were applied. Cathodal stimulation decreased, whereas anodal stimulation increased the amplitude of the N70 component. The effect of cathodal stimulation was significant immediately after and 10 minutes after the end of stimulation, if the stimulation duration was sufficiently long (i.e., 10-15 minutes). An increase of N70 amplitude by anodal stimulation was significant only 10 minutes after the end of the 15 minutes tDCS. Cathodal stimulation tended also to affect the amplitude of the P100 component; however, the effect of stimulation was inverse. The amplitude increased immediately after the end of cathodal stimulation. In contrast, anodal stimulation did not affect the P100. The latencies of the N70 and the P100 were not affected by tDCS. CONCLUSIONS. tDCS appears to be a suitable method of inducing reversible excitability changes in a polarity-specific way, not only in the motor but also in the primary visual cortex. The duration of the induced aftereffects depends not only on stimulation duration but also on stimulation polarity. Cathodal stimulation seems to be more effective, in line with previous reports on the motor cortex.},

abstract = {There has been an explosion of research using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for investigating and modulating human cognitive and motor function in healthy populations. It has also been used in many studies seeking to improve deficits in disease populations. With the slew of studies reporting "promising results" for everything from motor recovery after stroke to boosting memory function, one could be easily seduced by the idea of tDCS being the next panacea for all neurological ills. However, huge variability exists in the reported effects of tDCS, with great variability in the effect sizes and even contradictory results reported.

In particular, we discuss the importance of baseline neuronal state and features, anatomy, age and the inherent variability in the injured brain. We additionally consider how interindividual variability affects the results of motor-evoked potential (MEP) testing with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which, in turn, can lead to apparent variability in response to tDCS in motor studies.},

abstract = {Effects of weak electrical currents on brain and neuronal function were first described decades ago. Recently, DC polarization of the brain was reintroduced as a noninvasive technique to alter cortical activity in humans. Beyond this, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of different cortical areas has been shown, in various studies, to result in modifications of perceptual, cognitive, and behavioral functions. Moreover, preliminary data suggest that it can induce beneficial effects in brain disorders. Brain stimulation with weak direct currents is a promising tool in human neuroscience and neurobehavioral research. To facilitate and standardize future tDCS studies, we offer this overview of the state of the art for tDCS.},

Overview of tDCS parameters and practices to inform and standardize.

Subject 
Provides a table containing the parameters and outcome of virtually every tDCS study from 1998-2008. Names multiple aspects that should be taken into consideration when designing and interpretating tDCS studies (see below).

Key findings 
See the italicized paragraphs in the paper for summaries of the following points:

1. strength of tDCS effects is determined by current density and duration (p.207, 218).

2. Polarity and position of electrodes may lead to different effects (p. 207).

3. Appropriate electrode material and method of application minimize unwanted electrical phenomena( p. 217).

4. Focality of stimulation can to some extent be controlled and may impact stimulation effects (p. 217).

5. Blinding of subjects to tDCS conditions is crucial; ramping up the current is most important factor controlling sensation (p. 217).

6. Traits and state (mental/cortical) of subjects influence the efficacy of tDCS (p. 218).

7. Only a few seconds of tDCS can already cause changes in neural excitability (p. 218).

8. After-effects of stimulation can be elicited after 10 minutes of tDCS (p. 218).

9. Repeated application of tDCS may stabilize these induced changes (p.218). 

10. Safety of current protocols is increasingly established, but be cautions when deviating from them or using clinical populations (p.219).

Outstanding questions 

Significance 
Very useful summary of pre-2008 studies, and provides a thorough overview of many considerations when designing a tDCS study and reporting its results.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) and the right frontal eye field (rFEF) form part of a network of brain areas involved in orienting spatial attention. Previous studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have demonstrated that both areas are critically involved in the processing of conjunction visual search tasks, since stimulation of these sites disrupts performance. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of long term neuronal modulation to rPPC and rFEF using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the aim of uncovering sharing of these resources in the processing of conjunction visual search tasks. METHODS: Participants completed four blocks of conjunction search trials over the course of 45 min. Following the first block they received 15 min of either cathodal or anodal stimulation to rPPC or rFEF, or sham stimulation. RESULTS: A significant interaction between block and stimulation condition was found, indicating that tDCS caused different effects according to the site (rPPC or rFEF) and type of stimulation (cathodal, anodal, or sham). Practice resulted in a significant reduction in reaction time across the four blocks in all conditions except when cathodal tDCS was applied to rPPC. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of cathodal tDCS over rPPC are subtler than those seen with TMS, and no effect of tDCS was evident at rFEF. This suggests that rFEF has a more transient role than rPPC in the processing of conjunction visual search and is robust to longer-term methods of neuro-disruption. Our results may be explained within the framework of functional connectivity between these, and other, areas.},

These problems are demonstrated revisiting replications of three famous findings: the embodiment of morality, the endowment effect, and weather {\&} happiness. A new approach is proposed. It combines effect-size estimation with null hypothesis testing into a single test. It evaluates if replications rule-out an effect big enough to be detectable with the original study. Benefits include: (i) distinguishing p{\textgreater}.05 replications that are simply too-noisy from those that indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (ii) “protecting” true findings from underpowered replications, (iii) incorporating effect size estimation within a hypothesis-testing framework, and vice versa, and (iv) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular.},

This resulted in four experimentalmanipulations in which sham tDCS was applied in week one followed by active tDCS the following week. Another group received sham stimulation in both sessions to investigate practice effects over 1 week in this task. Results show that there is no difference between effects seen when the anode is placed ipsi or contralaterally. Cathodal stimulation of rPPC increased search times straight after stimulation similarly for ipsi and contralateral references. This finding does not extend to rFEF stimulation. However, for both sites and bothmontages, practice effects as seen in the sham/sham condition were negated. This can be taken as evidence that for this task, reference placement on either frontal pole is not important, but also that care needs to be taken when contextualizing tDCS “effects” that may not be immediately apparent particularly in between-participant designs.},

@article{Medina2017,
abstract = {A substantial number of studies have been published over the last decade, claiming that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can influence performance on cognitive tasks. However, there is some skepticism regarding the efficacy of tDCS, and evidence from meta-analyses are mixed. One major weakness of these meta-analyses is that they only examine outcomes in published studies. Given biases towards publishing positive results in the scientific literature, there may be a substantial “file-drawer” of unpublished negative results in the tDCS literature. Furthermore, multiple researcher degrees of freedom can also inflate published p-values. Recently, Simonsohn, Nelson and Simmons (2014) created a novel meta-analytic tool that examines the distribution of significant p-values in a literature, and compares it to expected distributions with different effect sizes. Using this tool, one can assess whether the selected studies have evidential value. Therefore, we examined a random selection of studies that used tDCS to alter performance on cognitive tasks, and tDCS studies on working memory in a recently published meta-analysis (Mancuso et al., 2016). Using a p-curve analysis, we found no evidence that the tDCS studies had evidential value (33{\%} power or greater), with the estimate of statistical power of these studies being approximately 14{\%} for the cognitive studies, and 5{\%} (what would be expected from randomly generated data) for the working memory studies. It is likely that previous tDCS studies are substantially underpowered, and we provide suggestions for future research to increase the evidential value of future tDCS studies.},

Although these observations are highly intriguing, the underlying mechanisms of such enhancements are still poorly understood. Here, we argue that in order to advance understanding of these mechanisms, it is necessary to focus on intrinsic network dynamics in the brain. Taking into account well-known network dynamics, increased excitation in one particular network or brain region may necessarily lead to inhibition of an opposing network (and vice versa). As a consequence, observed behavioral improvements due to NBS emerge from a shift in the balance between (competing) neural networks in the brain, implicating that behavioral enhancement due to stimulation most likely comes with a cost or side effect. We conclude that more elaborate experimental designs are essential for a better understanding of the relationship between network interactions and the behavioral effects of NBS.},

abstract = {Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that is affordable and easy to operate compared to other neuromodulation techniques. Anodal stimulation increases cortical excitability, while the cathodal stimulation decreases it. Although tDCS is a promising treatment approach for chronic pain as well as for neuropsychiatric diseases and other neurological disorders, several complex neurobiological mechanisms that are not well understood are involved in its effect. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the current knowledge regarding the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the effects of tDCS. The initial search resulted in 171 articles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we screened 32 full-text articles to extract findings about the neurobiology of tDCS effects including investigation of cortical excitability parameters. Overall, these findings show that tDCS involves a cascade of events at the cellular and molecular levels. Moreover, tDCS is associated with glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic activity modulation. Though these studies provide important advancements toward the understanding of mechanisms underlying tDCS effects, further studies are needed to integrate these mechanisms as to optimize clinical development of tDCS.},

abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a tool for inducing transient disruptions of neural activity noninvasively in conscious human volunteers. In recent years, the investigative domain of TMS has expanded and now encompasses causal structure-function relationships across the whole gamut of cognitive functions and associated cortical brain regions. Consequently, the importance of how to determine the target stimulation site has increased and a number of alternative methods have emerged. Comparison across studies is precluded because different studies necessarily use different tasks, sites, TMS conditions, and have different goals. Here, therefore, we systematically compare four commonly used TMS coil positioning approaches by using them to induce behavioral change in a single cognitive study. Specifically, we investigated the behavioral impact of right parietal TMS during a number comparison task, while basing TMS localization either on (i) individual fMRI-guided TMS neuronavigation, (ii) individual MRI-guided TMS neuronavigation, (iii) group functional Talairach coordinates, or (iv) 10-20 EEG position P4. We quantified the exact behavioral effects induced by TMS using each approach, calculated the standardized experimental effect sizes, and conducted a statistical power analysis in order to calculate the optimal sample size required to reveal statistical significance. Our findings revealed a systematic difference between the four approaches, with the individual fMRI-guided TMS neuronavigation yielding the strongest and the P4 stimulation approach yielding the smallest behavioral effect size. Accordingly, power analyses revealed that although in the fMRI-guided neuronavigation approach five participants were sufficient to reveal a significant behavioral effect, the number of necessary participants increased to n = 9 when employing MRI-guided neuronavigation, to n = 13 in case of TMS based on group Talairach coordinates, and to n = 47 when applying TMS over P4. We discuss these graded effect size differences in light of the revealed interindividual variances in the actual target stimulation site within and between approaches.},

@article{Monte-Silva2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-invasive brain stimulation enables the induction of neuroplasticity in humans, however, with so far restricted duration of the respective cortical excitability modifications. Conventional anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocols including one stimulation session induce NMDA receptor-dependent excitability enhancements lasting for about 1 h.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to extend the duration of tDCS effects by periodic stimulation, consisting of two stimulation sessions, since periodic stimulation protocols are able to induce neuroplastic excitability alterations stable for days or weeks, termed late phase long term potentiation (l-LTP), in animal slice preparations. Since both, l-LTP and long term memory formation, require gene expression and protein synthesis, and glutamatergic receptor activity modifications, l-LTP might be a candidate mechanism for the formation of long term memory.

METHODS: The impact of two consecutive tDCS sessions on cortical excitability was probed in the motor cortex of healthy humans, and compared to that of a single tDCS session. The second stimulation was applied without an interval (temporally contiguous tDCS), during the after-effects of the first stimulation (during after-effects; 3, or 20 min interval), or after the after-effects of the first stimulation had vanished (post after-effects; 3 or 24 h interval).

RESULTS: The during after-effects condition resulted in an initially reduced, but then relevantly prolonged excitability enhancement, which was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist. The other conditions resulted in an abolishment, or a calcium channel-dependent reversal of neuroplasticity.

CONCLUSION: Repeated tDCS within a specific time window is able to induce l-LTP-like plasticity in the human motor cortex.},

abstract = {To err is human. However, an inappropriate urge does not always result in error. Impulsive errors thus entail both a motor system capture by an urge to act and a failed inhibition of that impulse. Here we show that neuromodulatory electrical stimulation of the supplementary motor complex in healthy humans leaves action urges unchanged but prevents them from turning into overt errors. Subjects performed a choice reaction-time task known to trigger impulsive responses, leading to fast errors that can be revealed by analyzing accuracy as a function of poststimulus time. Yet, such fast errors are only the tip of the iceberg: electromyography (EMG) revealed fast subthreshold muscle activation in the incorrect response hand in an even larger proportion of overtly correct trials, revealing covert response impulses not discernible in overt behavior. Analyzing both overt and covert response tendencies enables to gauge the ability to prevent these incorrect impulses from turning into overt action errors. Hyperpolarizing the supplementary motor complex using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) preserves action impulses but prevents their behavioral expression. This new combination of detailed behavioral, EMG, and tDCS techniques clarifies the neurophysiology of impulse control, and may point to avenues for improving impulse control deficits in various neurologic and psychiatric disorders.},

Single-cell recordings in a motor area of the cerebral cortex in behaving rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used to evaluate two alternative mathematical models of the processes that underlie reaction times.

Stochastic variability in the rate at which neural activity grew toward that threshold resulted in the distribution of reaction times.

However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with in vivo intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials.},

abstract = {Single-unit recording studies in the macaque have carefully documented the modulatory effects of attention on the response properties of visual cortical neurons. Attention produces qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and among neurons in area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory signals might cause such increases in sensitivity.},

Indeed, many behavioral studies have demonstrated that emotional information can modulate visual attention and eye movements. The aim of the present study was to investigate (1) how irrelevant emotional face distractors affect saccadic behaviors and (2) whether such emotional effects reflect a specific neural mechanism or merely biased selective attention. We combined a visual search paradigm that incorporated manipulation of different types of distractor (fearful faces or scrambled faces) and delivered anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the superior temporal sulcus and the frontal eye field to investigate the functional roles of these areas in processing facial expressions and eye movements. Our behavioral data suggest that irrelevant emotional distractors can modulate saccadic behaviors. The tDCS results showed that while rFEF played a more general role in controlling saccadic behavior, rSTS is mainly involved in facial expression processing. Furthermore, rSTS played a critical role in processing facial expressions even when such expressions were not relevant to the task goal, implying that facial expressions and processing may be automatic irrespective of the task goal.},

abstract = {In vivo effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have attracted much attention nowadays as this area of research spreads to both the motor and cognitive domains. The common assumption is that the anode electrode causes an enhancement of cortical excitability during stimulation, which then lasts for a few minutes thereafter, while the cathode electrode generates the opposite effect, i.e., anodal-excitation and cathodal-inhibition effects (AeCi). Yet, this dual-polarity effect has not been observed in all tDCS studies. Here, we conducted a meta-analytical review aimed to investigate the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the effect sizes of the AeCi dichotomy in both motor and cognitive functions. The AeCi effect was found to occur quite commonly with motor investigations and rarely in cognitive studies. When the anode electrode is applied over a non-motor area, in most cases, it will cause an excitation as measured by a relevant cognitive or perceptual task; however, the cathode electrode rarely causes an inhibition. We found homogeneity in motor studies and heterogeneity in cognitive studies with the electrode's polarity serving as a moderator that can explain the source of heterogeneity in cognitive studies. The lack of inhibitory cathodal effects might reflect compensation processes as cognitive functions are typically supported by rich brain networks. Further insights as to the polarity and domain interaction are offered, including subdivision to different classes of cognitive functions according to their likelihood of being affected by stimulation.},
annote = {Tagline 
[title]

Subject 
Contains an overview and meta-analysis of facilitatory/inhibitory effects produced by anodal /cathodal tDCS effects in both motor and cognitive studies.

Key findings 
The anodal-excitation and cathodal-inhibition scheme only commonly occurs for motor cortex stimulation, and not for tDCS in cognitive studies.

The meta-analysis shows that the mean cathodal effect size is much smaller than anodal for cognitive studies, but there is no difference for motor studies.

Possible explanations: 
- Cognitive tasks call upon a network of brain areas; network function may be boosted by anodal tDCS, but downregulation only one node with cathodal is insufficient to affect performance.
- Motor effects are mostly assessed through MEPs; Outcome measures in cognitive studies vary greatly.
- Compensation from the equivalent area in the other hemisphere may occur for cognitive functions that are bilatereal, whereas the functional motor cortex is always contralateral.

Significance 
Useful reference when developing hypotheses/interpretations on the absence of any cathodal effects in studies. Underlines how overly simplistic the anodal-excitation cathodal-inhibition scheme probably is.},

abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

A sequence of points over the prefrontal cortex was stimulated until an effective site of the TMS was found that induced contralateral saccade delays. In 7 out of the 10 subjects, we were able to localize a region in the prefrontal cortex that when stimulated produced delays in the execution of contralateral saccadic eye movements. The location of this functionally defined FEF region across these subjects was approximately 1.5cm anterior to the motor hand area, although there was considerable variability in this measure. In the remaining 3 subjects, no site within our circumscribed probing was found that when disrupted with TMS produced delays in contralateral saccadic eye movements.

Using intracellular and extracellular recordings in rats, we find that at least 1 mV/mm voltage gradient is necessary to affect neuronal spiking and subthreshold currents. We designed an ‘intersectional short pulse' stimulation method to inject sufficiently high current intensities into the brain, while keeping the charge density and sensation on the scalp surface relatively low. We verify the regional specificity of this novel method in rodents; in humans, we demonstrate how it affects the amplitude of simultaneously recorded EEG alpha waves. Our combined results establish that neuronal circuits are instantaneously affected by intensity currents that are higher than those used in conventional protocols.},

@article{Duecker2015,
abstract = {Several competing theories on the mechanisms underlying attentional control have emerged over the years that, despite their substantial differences, all emphasize the importance of hemispheric asymmetries. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has proven particularly successful in teasing them apart by selective perturbation of the dorsal and ventral fronto-parietal network. We here critically review the TMS literature and show that hemispheric asymmetries within the dorsal attention network differ between parietal and frontal cortex. Specifically, posterior parietal cortex seems to be characterized by a contralateral bias of each hemisphere and competition between them. In contrast, the right frontal eye field seems to be involved in shifting attention toward both hemifields, whereas left frontal eye field is only involved on shifting attention toward the contralateral hemifield. In the light of presented evidence, we propose to revise the functional-anatomical model originally proposed by Corbetta and Shulman (2011, 2002) and introduce a hybrid model of hemispheric asymmetries in attentional control.},
