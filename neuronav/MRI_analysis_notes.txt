All files from S01-S15 were processed by me. From S16 to S33, most were processed by a student (with help from me), and some by me.

In this latter batch, sometimes there are multiple versions of scans (.nii, .nii.gz), and its not immediately clear which one was used to locate the FEF. In that case the screenshots should be able to give clarity.

Another problem the student had is that scans would be saved as ".gz" files from MRIcron (so neither an uncompressed .nii or an .nii.gz). These are just compressed NIfTIs, but fsl or the neuronav do not regocnize these. So in some instances they had to be resaved as ".nii.gz" with MRIcron.

If a subject has an "orig" folder, these will be the MRI files as I got them from the researcher (sometimes I only got a PAR/REC; in that case they will contain a .nii made by me as well).

Another problem is that the X-coordinate axes in FSL is sometimes flipped, such that the coordinates selected in MRIcron are suddenly in the left hemisphere instead of the right. Whenever this happens, the coordinates can be corrected by subtracting it from the other end of the scale (e.g., if the MRIcron coordinate is a 100, and the x-coordinates range from 0-300, the FSL coordinates would be 300-100 = 200).

Lastly, MRIcron starts counting at 1, whereas FSL starts at 0, so 1 has to be subtracted from all the coordinates.

In the end, to make sure we've got the right locations and to standardize the format, it would be best to pull both the scan that was used and the screenshot with the markers from the neuronav. Then, for each file, check that the coordinates correspond with FSL, and if not, manually match the two and note down the correct coordinates for FSL.
