# tDCS blinding

The tDCS device was preprogrammed with the stimulation parameters such that the study was double-blind: neither the experimenter nor the subjects knew which stimulation type was applied in which session.

The coding scheme was changed after 10 subjects, because the device had to be reprogrammed to remain compatible with another tDCS experiment that was run at the same time.

The coding was as follows (for details, see below). In subjects 1-10:

* 'C' was anodal stimulation.
* 'I' was cathodal stimulation.

In subjects 11-15:

* 'H' was anodal stimulation.
* 'A' was cathodal stimulation.

The "proof" for this can be found in two photos (`tDCS_blinding_S01-S10.pdf` and `tDCS_blinding_S11-S15.JPG`) that were not shown to the experimenter(s) during data collection.

## Subject 1-10 (files "S01" through "S10")

### Trial stimulation: Setting A

* Current: +1000 mA (anodal)
* Duration: 15 s
* Fade-in: 45 s
* Fade-out: 45 s

### Experimental stimulation: Setting C

* Current: +1000 mA (anodal)
* Duration: 900 s
* Fade-in: 60 s
* Fade-out: 60 s

### Other session

For __cathodal stimulation__, setting A (for trial stimulation) and C (for experimental stimulation) was loaded and the wires were connected to the stimulator the other way around. __This was coded as 'I' in the file names__.

## Subject 11-15 (files "S11" through "S15")

### Trial stimulation: Setting C

* Current: -1000 mA (cathodal)
* Duration: 15 s
* Fade-in: 45 s
* Fade-out: 45 s

### Experimental stimulation: Setting A

* Current: -1000 mA (cathodal)
* Duration: 900 s
* Fade-in: 60 s
* Fade-out: 60 s

### Other session

For __anodal stimulation__, setting C (for trial stimulation) and A (for experimental stimulation) was loaded and the wires were connected to the stimulator the other way around. __This was coded as 'H' in the file names__.
